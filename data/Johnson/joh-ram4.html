It had a profound influence on the development of the novel, though many writers of the 18th century would work to dissociate the genres, as Johnson does here. Formaally loose in structure, heroic romances also "deliberately eschew[ed] contemporaneity"; their plots featured courtly lovers engaged in "heroic stories of love and war in a remote and idealized past" (<a class="link_ref" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FPdRAwAAQBAJ">Shellinger, <span style="font-style:italic">Encyclopedia of the Novel</span>, 1046)</a>.

It was not used to store clothes. For more information, see <span style="font-style:italic">Daily Life in 18th-Century England</span> (85-86), or <a class="link_ref" href="https://english.illinoisstate.edu/digitaldefoe/teaching/bobker/overview.html">Danielle Bobker's "Literature and Culture of the Closet in the Eighteenth Century,"</a> from which site the accompanying image, showing the Green Closet at Frogmore, has been drawn.</span>, let loose his Invention, and heat his Mind with Incredibilities; and a Book was thus produced without Fear of Criticism, without the Toil of Study, without Knowledge of Nature, or Acquaintance with Life.</p><p>THE Task of our present Writers is very different; it requires, together with that Learning which is to be gained from Books, that Experience which can never be attained by solitary Diligence, but must arise from general Converse, and accurate Observation of the living World.

In this epistle to Augustus, Horace is mounting a defense of contemporary poetry and decrying the poor taste of the public. In particular he argues that though comic subjects are thought easier to write, they are actually more challenging than tragic subjects because readers give them less "indulgence."

Johnson references eighteenth-century thought about the power of the imagination to affect the body regardless of the will, like that discussed by <a class="link_ref" href="https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/gne/michel/essays/complete.html#book1.20">Michele de Montaigne in "Of the Power of the Imagination."</a> For information about the power of the female imagination to create monstrous beings, see, among other works, <a class="link_ref" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_nQredXpwaUC">&gt;Marie Hélène Huet's <span style="font-style:italic">Monstrous Imagination</span> (1993)</a>.</span> Care ought <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d29e388"><a href="images/022.jpg">[Page 22]</a></span> to be taken that, when the Choice is unrestrained, the best Examples only should be exhibited; and that which is likely to operate so strongly, should not be mischievous or uncertain in its Effects.</p><p>THE chief Advantages which these Fictions have over real Life is, that their Authors are at liberty, tho' not to invent, yet to select Objects, and to cull from the Mass of Mankind, those Individuals upon which the Attention ought most to be employ'd; as a Diamond, though it cannot be made, may be polished by Art, and placed in such a Situation, as to display that Lustre which before was buried among common Stones. </p><p>IT is justly considered as the greatest Excellency of Art, to imitate Nature; but it is necessary to distinguish those Parts of Nature, which are most proper for Imitation: Greater Care is still required in representing Life, which is so often discoloured by Passion, or deformed by Wickedness. If the World be promiscuously<a class="link_ref" href="a015"></a><span class="note" id="n015"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>"Promiscuous" here refers to a lack of distinction or discrimination; it is not primarily sexual.

The Purpose of these Writings is surely not only to show Mankind, but to provide that they may be seen hereafter with less Hazard; to teach the means of avoiding the Snares which are laid by TREACHERY for INNOCENCE, without infusing any Wish for that Superiority with which the Betrayer flatters his Vanity; to give the Power of counteracting Fraud without the Temptation to practise it; to initiate Youth by mock Encounters in the Art of necessary Defense, and to increase Prudence without impairing Virtue.<a class="link_ref" href="a016"></a><span class="note" id="n016"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>In this passage, Johnson articulates his sense of the purpose of novelistic writing.

Vice, for Vice is necessary to be shewn, should always disgust; nor should the Graces of Gaiety, or the Dignity of Courage, be so united with it, as to reconcile it to the Mind.
